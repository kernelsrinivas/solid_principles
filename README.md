# Solid Principles in Typescript
typescript basic for SOLID principles

The SOLID concepts are

#### The Single-responsibility principle: 
Every class should have only one responsibility.

#### The Openâ€“closed principle: 
"Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

#### The Liskov substitution principle: 
"Base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."

#### The Interface segregation principle: 
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

#### The Dependency inversion principle: 
"Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
